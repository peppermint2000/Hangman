**Hangman**

**A description of the project:**
A game where a secret word needs to be guessed by the user. The game randomly selects a word form the list given, the player has limited lives adn for each incorrect guess losses a life. The game also provides feedback on if the guess is correct and incorrect.
Milestone 2:a function called fruit_random that randomly selects a fruit from a list, prompts the user to input a single letter, and provides feedback on the validity of the input. 
Milestone 3: The script includes a check_guess function to handle user input, and the main section uses ask_for_input to continuously prompt until a correct guess is made.
Milestone 4:This Python class, Hangman, is designed for a hangman game, initialising with a word list andnumber of lives; it includes methods for user input, checking guessed letters, and updating the game state based on correct or incorrect guesses.
Milestone 5: Final stage of a word guessing game with a limited number of lives, providing feedback on correct and incorrect guesses, and determining the game outcome.

**What I learn from the project:**
1-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
*Understanding how to structure code using classes and methods 
*Organising the different functions into hangman class
2-Problem solving:
*Developing my problem solving skills by addressing issues and debbuging the code. 
3-User input handling:
*Ensureing proper handling of user inputs by implementing mechansims that allows accurate processing of user input.
